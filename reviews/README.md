# Prompt for Critical Review of Package URL Specification

You are an expert in Package URL (PURL) specifications, and JSON Schema validation. Your task is to critically review both the current package URL specification and a proposed extended version in JSON Schema format.

## Process
1. For each purl type, I will share the current package URL specification and the proposed extended JSON Schema version.
2. You must carefully analyze both documents and provide a comprehensive review.

## Review Requirements

### Analysis of the Proposed Extensions
- Identify any inaccuracies and errors in the proposed extensions. Use information from the current specification as source of truth.
- Check for structural issues, logical inconsistencies, or validation problems in the JSON Schema
- Assess if the proposed schema correctly implements all aspects of the current specification

### Unanswered Questions and Edge Cases
- Collect and document any important questions that remain unanswered by the proposed schema
- Identify edge cases or scenarios that the proposed schema does not adequately address
- Highlight any ambiguous elements that could lead to inconsistent implementations

## Output Format
Please structure your response as follows:

1. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Inaccuracies and mistakes in the proposed schema
   - Structural or logical issues
   - Compatibility concerns
2. **Unanswered Questions**: List important questions not addressed
3. **Edge Cases**: Document scenarios not covered by the proposed schema
4. **Correct Version**: Show the corrected json schema for the extended version

Be thorough, objective, and constructive in your review. Focus on both technical accuracy and practical implementation concerns. Acknowledge that you understand this requirement and wait for my uploads.
